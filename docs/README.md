# About Stand
Stand is a mod menu for Grand Theft Auto V made from scratch with the goal of providing a unique, polished, and efficient experience.

Stand was first released on the 17th of May, 2020, and since then has had around 180 updates. That roughly averages to one update every three days.

[Stand's official website](https://stand.gg) provides a general feature overview.
> **You are encouraged to try the free version by yourself**. The only limitation it has is the inability to be used in Online. Reference the documentation you aren't sure about a specific function.

# Why Stand?
**Stand does what other menus don't.**
- **At least weekly updates**. The product you paid for will constantly improve.
- Competitive pricing model:
	- Stand is available at four price points. [Free](https://stand.gg/Stand%20Launchpad.exe) ($0), [Basic](https://stand.gg/help/basic-edition) ($10), [Regular](https://stand.gg/help/regular-edition) ($25), [Ultimate](https://stand.gg/help/ultimate-edition) ($50). These are called "Editions". **Stand beats competitors at every single price point**.
- Robust Lua script loader ([documentation for developers](https://stand.gg/help/lua-api-documentation)).
- Script Hook V loader. Supports unloading and reloading, ScriptHookV.NET, and decieves online checks.
- Polish isn't an afterthought. Stand was built from the ground up to be stable, and free of game breaking bugs.
- Customization built into the core. And we aren't lying, you can customize Stand into an unrecognisable state. Try it.

# Edition Differences
As mentioned above, Stand is available in four editions. Free, Basic, Regular, and Ultimate.

Picking which edition is right for you can be challenging, especially if you're new to the modding scene and don't understand [the different features in each edition](https://stand.gg/#editions).

> If you end up wanting to upgrade your edition some time after purchasing, upgrade keys can be purchased.

The **Free** edition is perfect for people looking to try the menu before purchasing, it includes almost all options that are in Basic (differences are listed on the site). This edition is also perfect for people who don't care that much about using a menu in Online, and instead want to have a fun, singleplayer experience.

The **Basic** edition is perfect for new modders or modders who care little about changing the core gameplay of the game, instead wanting to improve it using various of Stand's features. (ex. Protections, Vehicle Spawner). Do not let the low price fool you however, Basic is a **feature complete** menu which contains features that competitors lock behind paywalls, and many Stand exlusive features. For $10, this has **incredible value**.

The **Regular** edition is perfect for an average modder who wants an all-around complete, and luxury experience, with extra features to halt other modders affecting your time playing. Regular also includes some goodies and quality of life features that will make your experience playing GTA noticeably better, specifically chat functions and the Web Interface (allowing you to use Stand whilst on your phone or another device).
