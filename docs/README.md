# About Stand
Stand is a mod menu for Grand Theft Auto V made from scratch with the goal of providing a unique, polished, and efficient experience.

Stand was first released on the 17th of May, 2020, and since then has had around 180 updates. That roughly averages to one update every three days.

[Stand's official website](https://stand.gg) provides a general feature overview.

?> **You are encouraged to try the free version yourself**. The only limitation it has is the inability to be used in Online. Reference the documentation you aren't sure about a specific function.

# Why Stand?
**Stand does what other menus don't.**
- Everything you would expect to be in a menu, and more.
- Safety isn't an issue, it's core to the menu. ([until you start trying to add money](https://stand.gg/help/money), but this applies with every menu).
- Stand doesn't break missions without sacrificing protections.
- Stand doesn't decrease your FPS.
- Stand supports (but does not encourage) coloading: [Co-loading guide](https://stand.gg/help/co-loading) (somewhat outdated)
- **At least weekly updates**. The product you paid for will constantly improve.
- Competitive pricing model:
	- Stand is available at four price points. [Free](https://stand.gg/Stand%20Launchpad.exe) ($0), [Basic](https://stand.gg/help/basic-edition) ($10), [Regular](https://stand.gg/help/regular-edition) ($25), [Ultimate](https://stand.gg/help/ultimate-edition) ($50). These are called "Editions". **Stand beats competitors at every single price point**.
- Robust Lua script loader ([documentation for developers](https://stand.gg/help/lua-api-documentation)).
- Script Hook V loader. Supports unloading and reloading, ScriptHookV.NET, and decieves online checks.
- Polish isn't an afterthought. Stand is built from the ground up to be stable, and free of game breaking bugs.
- Customization built into the core. And we aren't lying, you can customize Stand into an unrecognisable state. Try it.

# Edition Differences
As mentioned above, Stand is available in four editions. Free, Basic, Regular, and Ultimate.

Picking which edition is right for you can be challenging, especially if you're new to the modding scene and don't understand [the different features in each edition](https://stand.gg/#editions).

?> If you end up wanting to upgrade your edition some time after purchasing, upgrade keys can be purchased.

The **Free** edition is perfect for people looking to try the menu before purchasing, it includes almost all options that are in Basic (differences are listed on the site). This edition is also perfect for people who don't care that much about using a menu in Online, and instead want to have a fun, singleplayer experience.

The **Basic** edition is perfect for new modders or modders who care little about changing the core gameplay of the game, instead wanting to improve it using various of Stand's features. (ex. Protections, Vehicle Spawner). Do not let the low price fool you however, Basic is a **feature complete** menu which contains features that competitors lock behind paywalls, and many Stand exlusive features. For $10, this has **incredible value**.

The **Regular** edition is perfect for an average modder who wants an all-around complete, and luxury experience, with extra features to halt other modders affecting your time playing. Regular also includes some goodies and quality of life features that will make your experience playing GTA noticeably better, specifically chat functions and the Web Interface (allowing you to use Stand whilst on your phone or another device).

The **Ultimate** edition is the complete Stand experience, unlocking every single advanced and/or toxic feature in Stand. This is for the power-user that needs the extra features that ultimate provides or, more commonly, this is for the person who can't *stand* not having a product which limits functionality.

# Purchasing Guide
?> **As a prerequisite and some obligitory information**. Stand is purchased through resellers (unless you're willing to pay using Bitcoin), these resellers sometimes charge more than the listing price, this can be apparent when you factor in fees such as PayPal.
## Where should I purchase? {docsify-ignore}
Stands website has a list of **official** resellers for [Basic](https://stand.gg/help/basic-edition), [Regular](https://stand.gg/help/regular-edition), and [Ultimate](https://stand.gg/help/ultimate-edition).

These resellers sell at different rates but do deliver the same product, I recommend to pick the payment method you like, then choose the cheapest seller (but be careful as some of them add fees on checkout).

!> Most resellers use 3rd-party shops. These will usually send you 2 emails, one containing the License Key, and one containing an Order ID or some sort of 'Feedback' page, **Stand requires the License Key**. If you don't see the email, check your spam/junk folder.

For obvious reasons, once a License Key is redeemed, it **cannot be refunded**.

# Redeem a License Key
Before redeeming, I want to clear up what the different types of keys are and the process from buying a License Key, to using an activated copy of Stand. I understand it might be confusing for a new buyer and want to reduce the chance of you potentially making a fatal mistake.


<hr>


### License Key {docsify-ignore}
This is the key you get directly from your reseller after purchasing. **Do not confuse this with the Activation Key or Order ID**. This is the key you use to create an account (and with that, an Account ID). After account creation, a License Ley becomes useless.

### Account ID {docsify-ignore}

**Do not forget your account ID. There is no way to recover it. You lose access to Stand if you forget or lose your Account ID. You have been warned.** With that scary disclaimer out the way (it is true though, do not lose your Account ID), your Account ID effectively replaces your License Key, once redeemed (if you're curious, this change was put in place to secure you, as a buyer, from resellers stealing keys after they've been purchased by you). Your Account ID is needed to log into the website, the License Key is just used for registration.

</td>

?> **Do not share your Account ID**. Systems are in-place to automatically detect and suspend shared Account ID's. **Do not forget your account ID**. There is no way to recover it. You lose access to Stand if you forget or lose your Account ID. You have been warned. You can, however, share your Activation Key, with the restriction of only 1 instance of Stand can be running at one time.

</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Activation Key {docsify-ignore}
When logged in on the Stand website. you will see a box titled `Activation Key`. This box will contain text in this format: `Stand-Activate-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. You will also see a box labled `Download Launchpad`. Activation is not required to use the launchpad, but it is required to use a paid version of Stand. If you're reading this after just purchasing Stand, I recommend copying this to your clipboard.

<hr>


Now, with that out of the way. **This is the step-by-step guide on how to go from a License Key to an activated Stand copy**.

1. [Register an account](https://stand.gg/account/register) using your License Key that you've just purchased.
2. It will prompt you to save your newly generated Account ID. **Do it, seriously**.
3. Copy your Activation Key.
4. Inject Stand, finish the tutorial, then press Enter under "Paste Activation Key". (if you're unsure how to inject, follow the Injection Guide)

# Injection Guide
?> **Some prerequisites**. You might need to create an anti-virus exclusion to open the launcher and inject Stand. This is typical in game cheats as anti-viruses typically flag injectors and cheats. You should also try following the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://stand.gg/help/troubleshooting) on the offical website before looking for any troubleshooting help here.

1. [Download the Launchpad](https://stand.gg/Stand%20Launchpad.exe). If Chrome flags it as a virus, press Control+D to open the Downloads page, then you can allow it from there.
2. Open the Launchpad and (optional): turn on 'Automatically inject when game starts'.
3. Open GTAV (and click Inject if you didn't enable 'Automatically inject when game starts').
4. If the game hasn't finished loading, wait...
5. Press Numpad+ to open Stand if you have a numpad, or F4 if you don't.

?> 'Automatically inject when game starts' will only automatically inject if you have the Launchpad open whilst opening GTA

?> Stand can be injected at any time.

### Common injection issues {docsify-ignore}

These problems can sometimes happen. The first solution may not work but it's generally a pretty broad issue, so here's some generic fixes.

**When you injected Stand. Did the Launchpad say `0/1 injected` or `1/1 injected`**? If the former is true, this is usually caused by a lack of permission, this however, has a simple fix. Just run the Launchpad as Administrator. If that doesn't solve it, then an anti-virus is most likely blocking the injection, so disable that or exclude the Launchpad.
